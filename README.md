## Description
Our project is a simple game where you are presented with cars at an interception, each car has a number on it and an arrow signaling the path it wants to take, the objective is to guide each car trough the interception in the right order using hand and arms gestures.
This movements can help reabilitate the upper limbs.

## Objective
Our objective is to create an envirorment to train the upper limbs while also training perception in a somewhat familiar envirorment.

## Development:
* [Simone Basso](https://github.com/clbsimone): Using Blender, a 3D modeling software, I created all the 3D models present in the video game. I spent some time studying the program's functions and faced some initial difficulties, as I had never used it before. However, I overcame the obstacles and managed to complete the work within the expected timeframe.
